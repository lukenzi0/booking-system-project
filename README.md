# What is it?

This is my A-level Systems Software Development project. It consists of Windows forms, C#, and SQL in a .NET environment to build a booking app. Its main intended purpose was for receptionists or secretaries to be able to quickly and effectively manage bookings, their times and dates, and any required payment information. This was developed using Visual Studio 2015. This also includes documentation for testing, final designs, data dictionaries, user requirements, etc. Here is a breakdown of the project.

## **Staff**

  -personal details included
	
## **Payments**

  -auto-generated based on the booking type and time
	
  -recurring payments which could have an initial lump sum paid or later
	
  -displayed the current payment status
	
  -displayed late payments and incurred extra cost
	
  -displayed bills for any selected business
	
  -kept track of deposit
	
## **Simulated Debit/Credit cards**

  -Used to make payments
	
  -Used basic verification in the form of a CVC
	
  -Unfortunately, did not keep track of simulated money due to being out of the scope of the project

 ## **Calendar system**
-Custom-built using a datagrid object.

-Allows the option to choose what room you are looking at

 -Keeps track of offices and conference rooms using color codes that represent booked, not booked, or partially booked in the case of a conference room.

 ## **The booking system**

 -This allows you to make a conference or office booking
 	-Offices can only be booked in blocks of 3 months
	-Conference rooms can be booked for the first and/or last half of a single day

 -Must add payment information

 -Must add business name
